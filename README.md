 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo)

<h2>Description</h2>
"Our organization is committed to enhancing the security of our system. My responsibility involves guaranteeing the system's safety, scrutinizing potential security concerns, and updating employee computers as required. The subsequent steps offer illustrations of how I employed SQL along with filters to execute security-related operations.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>SQL</b> 

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Linux</b> 

<h2>Walk-through:</h2>

Retrieve failed login attempts that occurred after business hours. A potential security incident took place after regular business hours (after 18:00).
